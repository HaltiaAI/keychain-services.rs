Rust binding for macOS Keychain Services, including TouchID-guarded access to
cryptographic keys stored in the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP).

## Tests

This crate has two suites of tests:

- Core: `cargo test` - run a minimal set of tests (e.g. in CI) that work
  everywhere, but don't cover all functionality.
- Interactive: `cargo test --features=interactive-tests --no-run`
  compile tests which require user interactions, and additionally must be
  signed by macOS's code signing in order to work. See code signing notes.

## Code Signing

The Keychain Service API requires signed code to access much of its
functionality. Accessing many APIs from an unsigned app will return
an `ErrorKind::MissingEntitlement`.

Follow the instructions here to create a self-signed code signing certificate:
